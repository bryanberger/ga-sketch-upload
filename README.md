## [PoC] Sketch to Dropbox Realtime Dashboard

### How?
- The .sketchplugin uploads all selected Sketch artboards to this node server
- The node server brokers a deal with the Dropbox API and uploads the images to the Dropbox App's folder [Create a Dropbox App](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
- Some crazy hacks going on here as well..just ignore.

### Sketch plugin
Not hosted on github (yet)
